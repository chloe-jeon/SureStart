Having been a long-time creative writer, I found it interesting how elements of storytelling can be used to create a compelling argument and get people to listen, two important qualities of effective leadership.

##### What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Supervised learning is when the model is given the answers and given feedback after each training step. Examples include regression tasks and classification tasks. In contrast, unsupervised learning is when the model is expected to find patterns in the data without any feedback regarding the correct answer. The primary task for unsupervised learning is clustering.
##### Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
Scikit-learn specifically has the tools needed to sort through and describe data and produce decision trees. However, it does not include the ability to produce images; graphs and diagrams produced by other Python libraries are needed in order to visualize the data in a way that is easy for humans to understand.
