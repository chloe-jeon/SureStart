I'm excited to learn more about deep learning algorithms and how to improve models. Also, I the create-a-thon aspect sounds like a new and interesting approach to AI, compared to my previous experiences in the field.

Having been a long-time creative writer, I found it interesting how elements of storytelling can be used to create a compelling argument and get people to listen, two important qualities of effective leadership.

##### What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Supervised learning is when the model is given the answers and given feedback after each training step. Examples include regression tasks and classification tasks. In contrast, unsupervised learning is when the model is expected to find patterns in the data without any feedback regarding the correct answer. The primary task for unsupervised learning is clustering.
##### Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
Scikit-learn specifically has the tools needed to sort through and describe data and produce decision trees. However, it does not include the ability to produce images; graphs and diagrams produced by other Python libraries are needed in order to visualize the data in a way that is easy for humans to understand.

One problem that I think could be solved with machine learning is spam detection. Currently, the softwares involved in spam detection are extremely inaccurate, and more often than not, manual rules are far more helpful than the hundreds of crucial emails that go unread due to them being classified as spam (which necessitates reading through emails labelled as spam, which defeats the whole purpose of the algorithm).
Here's a dataset I found sorting emails into "ham" or spam. https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset
I think simple algorithms like the decision tree we made for practice would be rather ineffective at such a complex problem, seeing as how currently-implemented algorithms do absolutely terribly at this task. Rather, I think that a more complex algorithm involving natural language processing and deep learning might do better.
As a side note, I think there ought to be an option to enable spam algorithms to become tailored to individuals' preferences. What some people consider spam may not be necessarily identical to another's idea. Some are clearly important or spam, but I think there is an enormous gray area.
